I am an MS in Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a software engineer with over four years of experience. Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Arcesium, an intern at both Amazon and Arcesium, and an undergraduate Computer Science student at BITS Pilani. Here is an [artist's](https://www.instagram.com/kindofahappystory/) rendition of me:
