Delta Lake provides ACID guarantees and efficient
metadata management for single-table workloads on
cloud object stores, but lacks native support for atomic
operations spanning multiple tables. In this work, we
introduce *transaction groups* (or T-Groups), a protocol
extension that enables multi-table transactions using
only object-store primitives â€” no external coordinators
required. We implement our design in `delta-rs-mt`, a fork
of the `delta-rs` library, and evaluate on
TPC-DS benchmarks. We find that single-table operations incur
<0.25s of write overhead and reads show <3%
latency increase; multi-table writes exhibit predictable
log-contention. Our approach seamlessly integrates with
existing Delta Lake features, making robust multi-table
ACID transactions practical for large-scale analytics
without relying on external coordination services.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/naveen-u/delta-rs-mt) and the full report is available below.
